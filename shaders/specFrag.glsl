	// Calculate specular lighting
	// The specular color is similar to the the regular texture.
	// It determines what colors are reflected by the surface.
	vec4 specularColor = texture(specularMap, uv);

	// While diffuse light is deflected from the surface in all directions, specular light
	// is light that reflects in a specific path. The shinier an object, (for example, a mirror)
	// the less scattered the reflection is.
	// Here we calculate the vector of our light ray reflected by our normal vector:
	vec3 reflectDir = normalize(reflect(-lightDir, norm));

	// We also need the direction of the surface to our camera:
	vec3 surfaceToEyeDir = normalize(vec3(cameraPosition) - position);

	// Taking the dot product of the two will give us a value between -1 and 1.
	// 1 is very close to a perfect reflection, and -1 is the complete opposite direction.
	float specularLight = dot(reflectDir, surfaceToEyeDir);

	// Next we raise that value to the power of our specular exponent (determines how shiny an object is)
	// The higher the number, the closer it will stay to 1 as it's multiplied, but lower numbers will become significantly smaller to not reflect.
	// We also have to clamp between -1 and 1 here, because -1 to an even power would give us a positive light value and that doesn't make any sense.
	// And finally it's multiplied by attenuation, the same way it is with diffuse lighting
	specularLight = pow(clamp(specularLight, 0.0, 1.0), specularExponent) * attenuation;

	// Lastly multiply the color from our specular map with the light color, and scale by the strength of the specular light, and we have our value!
	vec4 finalSpecularColor = specularColor * pointLightColor * specularLight;



	// finally, sample from the texuture and apply the light.
	vec4 color = texture(diffuseMap, uv);
	gl_FragColor = (color * finalDiffuseColor) + finalSpecularColor;
